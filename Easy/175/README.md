=====
Description
===
A bogo sort is a purposefully inefficient algorithm for sorting a sequence. Today we will be using this for strings to test for equality.
Inputs & Outputs
===
Given a scrambled string N and another string M. You must sort N so that it matches M. After it has been sorted, it must output how many iterations it took to complete the sorting.
Sample Inputs & Outputs
===
Input:
